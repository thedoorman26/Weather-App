# Overview

This is a project I am working on to get better familiarized with more complex aspects of Java, specifically with handling API calls.

The program calls to api.weather.gov to generate weather forecasts for any set of coordinates, with a few presets baked in. It uses fasterxml.jackson to enable API calls, and it uses Maven to enable the implentation of fasterxml.jackson.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I chose API calls because I find them to be both very interesting, as well as something that I had been pretty unfamiliar with, so I thought this would be a good chance to broaden my skillset and learn something valuable.

Here's a link to a demonstration of the software:

# Development Environment

-Visual Studio Code IDE
-Java, using Maven
-Imported the fasterxml.jackson library

# Future Work

In the future I would like to add:

- The ability to run the program outside of the VS Code terminal
- Alternate forecast types
